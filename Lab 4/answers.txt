Problem 2B
----------

/* Fix me */
FIFO demonstrates a non-linear relationship between cores and execution time. As we increase the number of cores, the execution time approaches a limit. This happens because the processes being executed in itself are the limiting factor rather than the cores executing them.
Problem 3B
----------

/* Fix me */
Longest Remaining Time Scheduler is almost impossible to simulate in real life bcause approximating what the time a process is being executed is in itself causes the time approximation to be inaccurate.
LRTF has a lower waiting time than that of FIFO. LRTF executes the longer processes first, therefore, there's much less waiting time for the shorter processes. This contrasts the FIFO which could be random order of the processes times.
Problem 4B
----------

/* Fix me */
800 ms - 325.4s
600 ms - 314.5s
400 ms - 298.8s
200 ms - 285.2s
The shortest time slice is not the best choice because the time processes could be greater than the given time slice. In that case, most of the processes would be preempted therefore take longer to execute.
